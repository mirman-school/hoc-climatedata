# Visualizing Climate Data: Hour of Code 2016

In this exercise, you will use the Python programming language to analyze a dataset to discover patterns, trends, and truths about weather data in our area.

## What's in the box
Having downloaded this folder, you see several files:

* `README.md`: This file you're reading RIGHT NOW
* `dataloader.py`: A helper library that will load the data usefully for us to explore
* `explorer.py`: Helper functions for you to explore and filter the data
* `visualizer.py`: Where you create the visualizations of the data
* `tempdata.csv`: The raw data. You can look at this if you want, but we actually don't use it once it passes through the code in `dataloader.py`

## How to read these files
